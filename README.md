# Study Hour vs. Academic Performance_ A Predictive Analysis

## Objective:

This project aims to employ supervised machine learning, particularly linear regression, to forecast the percentage of marks that students can achieve based on the number of hours they dedicate to studying. By leveraging this predictive model, we seek to provide educators and students with a reliable tool to anticipate academic performance, fostering better study habits and facilitating targeted support for students aiming to excel in their studies.
